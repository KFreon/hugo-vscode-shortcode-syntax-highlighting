# Hugo Shortcode Syntax Highlighting  

## Features  
Hugo Shortcodes can get complicated when there are more than one or two parameters.  
This extension adds some syntax highlighting for Shortcodes, making visual identification of individual pieces easier.  
For example, some shortcodes are below.

## Notes  
Positional parameters are not really supported. They just get highlighted like the Shortcode name.
